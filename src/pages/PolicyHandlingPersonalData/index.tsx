              Data subjects may revoke their consent to the processing of their
              personal data at any time, as long as it is not prevented by a legal or
              contractual provision. For these purposes, <strong> QQA Robotica AI S.A.S </strong> establishes
              that the Data Subject, Representative, or Authorized Person must send a
              communication attaching an identity document, prima facie evidence of
              having been a client/user/consumer/employee/supplier of <strong> QQA Robotica AI S.A.S</strong>,
              and send it through any of the following means:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Written communication: addressed to <strong> QQA Robotica AI S.A.S</strong>, which must include
                at least: Date of request, address, email address, phone number for
                notifications, and prima facie evidence of having been a
                client/user/consumer/employee/supplier of <strong> QQA Robotica AI S.A.S</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Email: <strong> QQA Robotica AI S.A.S </strong> has provided the following email address:
                Legal@Robotica AI S.A.Sai.com
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className='m-0 p-0 text-justify'>
              It should be noted that there are two modalities in which consent
              revocation can occur:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The first may be for all consented purposes, for which <strong> QQA Robotica AI S.A.S </strong>
                must completely cease the processing of the data subject's data.
              </li>
              <li>
                The second may apply to specific types of processing, such as for
                advertising or market research purposes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className='m-0 p-0 text-justify'>
              Partial revocation of consent safeguards other processing purposes that
              the controller, in accordance with the granted authorization, may carry
              out and with which the Data Subject agrees.
            </p>

            <p className='m-0 p-0 text-justify'>
              The complaint, request, or petition must be submitted through email:
