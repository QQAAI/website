              that the processing of biometric data does not inadvertently jeopardise
              the rights or safety of Data Subjects. It also aims to ensure that any new
              privacy enhancing technologies that may be developed over time can be
              adopted, enabling increased security of biometrics use cases.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4. DATA IDENTIFICATION</strong></p>
            <p>
              In the field of preference identification and biometric data collection,
              an advanced system has been developed that allows for detailed information
              gathering on user interaction with visual content, such as videos. This
              system is not based on the creation of traditional biometric data
              templates, but rather on the collection of specific data related to ocular
              behavior.<strong></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The system collects information such as gaze direction, the amount of time
              users fixate on certain directions, changes in pupil size, and the
              frequency of blinks while users watch a video. This data is automatically
              processed, allowing the machine to analyze it efficiently and effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              This method of storage and analysis enables individualization of each
              user, facilitating the execution of automatic actions and the creation of
              profiles based on observed preferences and behaviors. For example, based
              on the analysis of ocular data, the system can infer which parts of the
              video capture the user's attention the most, which generate more interest,
              and which are less appealing.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of identification and authentication, it is essential that the
              biometric data collected from different individuals be clearly
              distinguishable. These data act as unique identifiers for each person,
              similar to how an ID number identifies a person in an administrative
              context. Although these biometric data cannot reconstruct the original
              brain activity, their ability to uniquely identify each individual within
              the framework of automated processing is sufficient for the purposes of
              the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike an ID number, biometric data is not arbitrarily assigned to a
              person. Instead, it is generated directly from the observation of unique
              and unalterable physical characteristics of the individual, without the
              need to resort to third-party documents or databases. This approach
              ensures a high level of accuracy and security in preference and behavior
              identification, providing valuable information that can be used to enhance
              content personalization and user experience.
            </p>
            <p><strong>5. DATA COLLECTION</strong></p>
            <p><strong>5.1. PRIVATE PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Participant Registration:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When a participant registers in our system to participate with your
              biometric data to link analysis of your preferences based on ocular and
              neural activity., they will be asked to provide certain basic information,
              including their name, email, and identification number (ID or ID card).
            </p>
            <p>
              This information will not be stored in our databases and will only be used
              to contact the participant and verify his/her identity.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Invitation to Video Call:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once the participant has completed registration, they will be sent an
              invitation to join an online video call via Zoom. This invitation will
              provide details about the date and time of the video call, as well as a
              link to join.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              During the video call, a representative from our team will be present to
              verify the participant's identity. The participant should have their
              identification document (ID or ID card) handy during the call.
            </p>
            <p>
              The representative of our team will be in charge of the verification and
              therefore will be responsible for data management, however in this video
              call will only verify the identity will not be storage, use, or collection
              of personal data, or biometric data.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Verification Process:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              During the video call, the participant will be required to show their
              identification document in front of the webcam so that the team
              representative can verify that the name and photograph on the document
              match the participant's appearance in real-time. Additionally, the
              participant will be asked to perform certain actions to confirm their
              identity, such as smiling, moving their head, or blinking, to ensure that
              the person in the video call is indeed the same as the one on the
              identification document.
            </p>
            <p>
              The representative of our team will be in charge of the verification and
              therefore will be responsible for data management, however in this video
              call will only verify the identity will not be storage, use, or collection
              of biometric data.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Verification Outcome:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once the verification is completed, the participant will be informed
              whether they have been approved or not. If approved, they will be allowed
              to proceed with the registration process and participate in the
              corresponding event or activity. In case any issues arise during
              verification, additional instructions will be provided to the participant
              on how to proceed to resolve the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This process ensures efficient and accurate verification of participants'
              identities, thereby contributing to maintaining the security and integrity
              of our events or activities. Upon completion of the verification process,
              a verification code will be issued to the participant. QQA Robotica AI S.A.S will
              not store, use or collect data from the video call, and if a participant
              restricts the use of the data, all deleted data will be completely removed
              from the system and a confirmation receipt will be sent to the
              participant.
            </p>
            <p><strong>5.1. BIOMETRIC DATA IDENTIFICATION PROCESS</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once the user has been verified and registered on the platform, they are
              invited to participate in the identification of biometric data. The user
              provides their explicit consent for the collection and processing of their
              biometric data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specific biometric data related to ocular behavior while the user
              interacts with visual content, such as videos, is collected. This data may
              include gaze direction, the amount of time the user fixes their gaze on
              certain directions, changes in pupil size, and the frequency of blinks.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Processing and Analysis:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The collected biometric data is processed using advanced technology to
              analyze user behavior. Facial recognition algorithms and behavioral
              analysis techniques are used to identify patterns and user preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of the biometric data analysis are used to understand user
              preferences, which are used for NeuroMarketing purposes. After the process
              is completed on the platform, it generates the results. QQA Robotica AI S.A.S does
              not store the biometric data that led to the result. Therefore, the data
              projected through codes is deleted from our system, platform, device, and
              only the result of the user's preferences remains.

            <p><strong>6. TYPE OF DATA</strong></p>
            <p>
              In our company, we handle two main types of data: biometric data and
              personal private data. These types of data are essential for carrying out
              our operations and providing our services effectively and securely.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Biometric Data</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Biometric data pertains to the unique physical and behavioral
              characteristics of an individual. It includes information such as gaze
              direction, pupil size, blink frequency, and other patterns of ocular
              behavior. These data are used to identify and authenticate users, as well
              as to conduct behavior and preference analysis for NeuroMarketing
              purposes. Our company collects and processes biometric data securely and
              in compliance with relevant privacy regulations.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Personal Private Data (ID Number)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Personal private data is information that identifies or can be used to
              identify a specific individual. It includes data such as identification
              numbers (IDs), names, addresses, email addresses, and other sensitive
              personal information. In our case, the ID number is considered personal
              private data, as it can uniquely identify an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              These data are primarily used for identity verification and user
              registration on our platform. Our company implements robust security
              measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of this data,
              including the deletion of data once it is no longer needed for the
              intended purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, our company manages and responsibly uses biometric data and
              personal private data, ensuring the security and protection of our users'
              privacy at all times.

            <p>
              The data obtained includes personal and biometric information collected
              during the registration process on our platform. To ensure the security
              and privacy of our users, we request prior authorization to collect and
              process personal data such as names, email addresses, and identification
              numbers. Additionally, through advanced biometric analysis techniques, we
              gather data related to users' eye behavior while interacting with visual
              content, such as videos. These biometric data include gaze direction,
              blink frequency, and other visual patterns, and are used to uniquely
              identify users and analyze their preferences for NeuroMarketing purposes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>9. DATA PROCESSING AND HANDLING</strong></p>
            <p>
              The processing and <strong></strong> management of data carried out by our
              company is a fundamental part of our strategy to offer personalized and
              relevant services to our customers. In our process, we gather personal
              data that enables us to understand users' preferences after they have
              watched a video on our platform. This data includes information such as
              viewing duration, interactions during the video, specific sections that
              capture their attention the most, and any post-viewing actions. By
              utilizing advanced data analysis techniques and information processing, we
              can extract patterns and behavioral trends that help us better comprehend
              the individual needs and preferences of consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we have obtained these valuable insights, we generate a result that
              summarizes the observed preferences and behaviors of each user. This
              result becomes a valuable resource that can be used for targeted and
              personalized marketing campaigns. Our company has the capability to market
              these results to third-party companies interested in reaching specific
              audiences with their products or services. By sharing this data
              responsibly and ethically, we contribute to creating more relevant and
              satisfying experiences for both users and companies seeking to connect
              with consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to emphasize that we maintain high standards of privacy
              and security at all times. We comply with all data protection regulations
              and laws to ensure that our users' information is handled securely and
              their privacy is respected. Additionally, we offer users the option to
              control how their data is used and provide transparency about our data
              handling practices. We firmly believe in the importance of user trust and

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sale of Analytical Information Results</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The analytical information derived from our data becomes a valuable
              resource for third parties. Companies in various sectors hire our services
              to host their videos on our platform, allowing consumers to view their
              content and ultimately understand consumer behavior and the emotions
              experienced while watching the video. These companies can use these
              insights to design and adjust their own marketing strategies, products,
              and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important for consumers and users to understand that their data is
              not sold to third parties. Instead, a company (third party) hires us to
              provide a report based on neuromarketing that details the preferences and
              emotions experienced by users while watching the video. The data received
              by the company (the third party) will not include personal or biometric
              data, as we only deliver a final report highlighting the moments when the
              user experienced emotions such as disgust or enthusiasm due to ocular and
              neural activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              QQA Robotica AI S.A.S explicitly states that the data obtained will only reflect
              emotions presented by the consumer while watching the video and will not
              include any identification data. As a result, we deliver a final report
              that answers all marketing-related questions without storing or providing
              any consumer data.
            </p>
            <p>Understanding Consumer Intentions</p>
            <p>
              The results we commercialize provide companies with a clear understanding
              of consumer intentions. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Presented Emotions: Emotions displayed while watching the video.</li>
              <li>Preferences: Specific likes and dislikes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The feedback obtained through the commercialization of our data also helps
              companies improve their videos through which they market products and
              services.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Transparency and Trust</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We ensure high standards of privacy and security at all times. We clearly
              inform users about how their data will be used and provide options for
              controlling the use of their information. This approach fosters user trust
              and ensures that our data collection and commercialization practices are
              conducted ethically and responsibly.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, data collection in our company not only allows us to improve
              digital marketing strategies but also provides valuable insights to third
              parties, helping them better understand consumer intentions and optimize
              their own operations and marketing campaigns.

            </ul>
            <p>
              In conclusion, Consent of the Owner is a fundamental principle in data
              protection, ensuring that individuals maintain control over their personal
              and biometric data. It requires explicit, informed, and voluntary
              agreement from the data subject, with mechanisms in place for easy
              withdrawal of consent and ongoing transparency. This approach not only
              ensures legal compliance but also fosters trust and ethical data
              management.
            </p>
            <p><strong>13. USE AND NON-STORAGE</strong></p>
            <p>
              Use and Non-Storage refers to the practice of processing personal data,
              including biometric information, in such a way that these data are used
              for a specific purpose and then not permanently stored in any database.
              This approach ensures that sensitive data is used only when absolutely
              necessary and is deleted immediately after fulfilling its purpose,
              minimizing the risks associated with prolonged data storage.Personal and
              biometric data are only processed for clearly defined and legitimate
              purposes. Once the purpose has been fulfilled, the data is not stored or
              retained.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the data has been used for its specific purpose, it is securely and
              completely deleted from all systems and records, ensuring it is not stored
              long-term. By not permanently storing personal and biometric data, the
              risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security issues is
              significantly reduced.
            </p>
            <p>
              This practice helps comply with data protection regulations that emphasize
              minimizing data storage and protecting individual privacy. Data is used in
              real-time or for a very short period for the specific purpose for which it
              was collected. Once this purpose is fulfilled, the data is immediately
              deleted. While the data is being used, robust security measures are
              implemented to protect the information from any unauthorized access or
              misuse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Records of all data processing activities are maintained to ensure
              transparency and accountability in the use and deletion of the
              data.Training all employees and stakeholders on the importance of use and
              non-storage of data and on the proper procedures for handling and deleting
              personal and biometric data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ensures that individuals’ privacy is protected by minimizing the amount of
              time personal and biometric data is at risk.Decreases the risk of data
              breaches and unauthorized access, as data is not stored beyond what is
              necessary.Helps comply with data protection laws and regulations that
              require the minimization of data storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Builds user trust by demonstrating a commitment to protecting their
              privacy and minimizing risks associated with data storage. In conclusion,
              the concept of Use and Non-Storage is fundamental to data protection,
              ensuring that personal and biometric information is used only when
              necessary and deleted immediately afterward. This approach minimizes
              risks, protects individuals' privacy, and complies with data protection
              regulations, thereby strengthening trust and ethical data management.

            <p><strong>16. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p>
              In our policy for managing biometric and personal data, we adopt a limited
              retention approach that ensures maximum privacy and security for our
              users. In this context, we commit to not retaining or storing the personal
              data provided beyond what is strictly necessary to fulfill our objectives
              and obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong><u>Principles</u></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.1. Limited Retention:</strong> We commit to retaining and
              storing only the ID associated with each individual in our records. This
              ID serves as a unique reference to identify users in our systems, without
              revealing their actual identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.2. Deletion of Biometric and Personal Data:</strong> Once the
              report is obtained or the task for which biometric or personal data was
              provided is completed, we proceed to permanently delete all this
              information from our records. This includes any biometric data, as well as
              other personal data that may have been provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.3. Data Security:</strong> We implement robust security measures
              to protect both the ID and any other data stored for the necessary time.
              This includes data encryption, restricted access, and other security
              controls to prevent unauthorized access or any misuse.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.4. Transparency and Accountability:</strong> We maintain a
              policy of full transparency regarding our data management. We inform our
              users about our limited retention procedures and ensure them that their
              data will be treated with the utmost care and responsibility.
            </p>
            <p><strong>17. BENEFITS FOR USERS</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>17.1. Enhanced Privacy:</strong> By deleting biometric and
              personal data after its use, we ensure the privacy and confidentiality of
              our users, avoiding any risk of exposure or misuse of the information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>17.2. Increased Trust:</strong> Our limited retention approach
              inspires trust among our users, demonstrating our commitment to protecting
              their privacy and data security.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>17.3. Regulatory Compliance:</strong> By complying with the
              principles of limited retention, we ensure compliance with applicable data
              protection regulations and laws, thus guaranteeing an ethical and legal
              management of personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, our policy for managing biometric and personal data with
              limited retention reflects our commitment to privacy, security, and
              transparency in the treatment of user information. By deleting personal
              data after its use, we protect the rights and privacy of our users while
              complying with the highest ethical and legal standards in data management.

              provides valuable insights into the user's emotions while watching the
              video, helping us better understand their responses and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's essential to emphasize that this information is solely used to
              enhance our services and products. We never share or sell personal data to
              third parties without the explicit consent of the user. Additionally, we
              commit to securely storing this data and permanently deleting it once it's
              no longer needed for our specific purposes. In summary, at QQA Robotica AI S.A.S,
              we strive to ensure the privacy and security of our users at all times. We

              acknowledge that brain activity is an intimate and personal aspect of the
              human experience, and we are dedicated to protecting the integrity and
              dignity of each user in processing their brain data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuro-rights are fundamental rights related to autonomy and cognitive
              freedom. At QQA Robotica AI S.A.S, we ensure that our methods and practices uphold
              these rights at all times. This entails ensuring that users have control
              over their brain information and that their consent is transparently and
              voluntarily obtained.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, we pledge to use brain information ethically and responsibly,
              avoiding any form of manipulation or exploitation. We strive to utilize
              this data in ways that benefit users and enhance their experience without
              compromising their autonomy or freedom of thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, at QQA Robotica AI S.A.S, we not only commit to protecting the privacy
              and security of our users' data but also strive to respect and safeguard
              their fundamental brain rights. This comprehensive approach reflects our
              dedication to ethics and respect in all our practices and services.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>26. VERIFY PROCESS</strong></p>
            <p>
              The process by which the participant verifies their identity is as
              follows:
            </p>
            <p><strong>26.1. Participant Registration:</strong></p>
            <p>
              When a participant registers in our system, they will be asked to provide
              certain basic information, including their name, email, and identification
              number (ID or ID card).
            </p>
            <p><strong>26.2. Invitation to Video Call:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Once the participant has completed registration, they will be sent an
              invitation to join an online video call via Zoom. This invitation will
              provide details about the date and time of the video call, as well as a
              link to join.
            </p>
            <p><strong>26.3. Identity Verification:</strong></p>
            <p>
              During the video call, a representative from our team will be present to
              verify the participant's identity. The participant should have their
              identification document (ID or ID card) handy during the call.<strong
              ></strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>26.4. Verification Process:</strong></p>
            <p>
              During the video call, the participant will be required to show their
              identification document in front of the webcam so that the team
              representative can verify that the name and photograph on the document
              match the participant's appearance in real-time. Additionally, the
              participant will be asked to perform certain actions to confirm their
              identity, such as smiling, moving their head, or blinking, to ensure that
              the person in the video call is indeed the same as the one on the
              identification document.
            </p>
            <p><strong>26.5. Verification Outcome:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Once the verification is completed, the participant will be informed
              whether they have been approved or not. If approved, they will be allowed
              to proceed with the registration process and participate in the
              corresponding event or activity. In case any issues arise during
              verification, additional instructions will be provided to the participant
              on how to proceed to resolve the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This process ensures efficient and accurate verification of participants'
              identities, thereby contributing to maintaining the security and integrity
              of our events or activities. The data will be kept for one day and the
              information will be deleted.
            </p>
